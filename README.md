Hello 👋, I'm António.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Technical Lead who works with the very talented [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) Engineering Team at [Consensys](https://consensys.io/). <br>

I'm into building clean and simple UX/UIs, with a clear user focus, as well as finding elegant and reliable solutions to complex problems.
Currently working with NodeJS, React & Typescript, 100% focused on expanding the reach and value of both platforms, MetaMask Mobile app and the browser extension.

You can reach me 📫 on [X](https://x.com/antoni0regadas) or [email](apregadas@gmail.com).
